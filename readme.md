  - This Section (10.1) shows how to build up a Quantum Fourier Transform circuit from theory to application;
  - first call back of basic function "root of unity"
  - and built step by step
  - from "QFT_1" to "QFT_n" and Inverse QFT 
- Isingmodel.ipynb:
  - From max-cut problem to construct a *Statevector* and costruct a *Cost Hamiltonian* to solve minimize problem. 0710
